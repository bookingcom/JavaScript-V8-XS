            * Support passing Perl objects with magic into JS.
            * If perl sub dies, handle by dying.

            * Treat references with more care:
              + Recursively dereference any references.
              + For \0 and \1, convert into false and true.
              + For any other references, use the underlying data.
            * Allow passing blessed objects to JS and back; ignore the fact
              that they are blessed and treat them as data.
            * Improve tests.

            * Bring back dispatch_function_in_event_loop() to have an easy
              migration path from this to eval(); we will remove it soon.
            * Make stacktraces more similar between Duktape and V8.

            * Convert JS booleans into JSON::PP::Boolean objects.
              This allows us to roundtrip, especially for cases such as
              reading a JSON file in JS (which will likely use booleans)
              and passing that to / from Perl.
            * Get rid of dispatch_function_in_event_loop().  It is
              actually better that calling eval() always tries to
              dispatch any pending timers after running the requested code.
            * Fixed wrong references to Duktape.

            * Code that display source for errors now is similar to Duktape's.
            * Clean up and expand perldoc.
