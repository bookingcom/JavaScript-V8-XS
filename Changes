            * Convert JS booleans into JSON::PP::Boolean objects.
              This allows us to roundtrip, especially for cases such as
              reading a JSON file in JS (which will likely use booleans)
              and passing that to / from Perl.
            * Get rid of dispatch_function_in_event_loop().  It is
              actually better that calling eval() always tries to
              dispatch any pending timers after running the requested code.
            * Fixed wrong references to Duktape.
