* Figure out how to use installed V8 includes / libraries.

* It is also necessary to specify the location of dynamic libraries at runtime
  using LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  For example:

    make && \
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/src/v8/out.gn/x64.release \
    perl -I blib/lib/ -I blib/arch/ -MJavaScript::V8::XS \
    -E'my $v8 = JavaScript::V8::XS->new(); $v8->run(q[let x=3+8; "Hi "+x]);'

* Figure out what to do with bin files, which are required:

     64K natives_blob.bin
    592K snapshot_blob.bin
    564K snapshot_blob_trusted.bin (only when running trusted code?)

  When not present, the errors are:
    Failed to open startup resource 'natives_blob.bin'.
    Failed to open startup resource 'snapshot_blob.bin'.

* Figure out what to do with dat files, which are required:

    9.8M icudtl.dat (only when using ICU?)
